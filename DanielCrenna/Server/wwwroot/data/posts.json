    "Body": "Immutability, or the inability for something to change once created, is a principle worth following far beyond double-entry accounting. An unused notebook seems full of promise, but the attachment to \u0027starting over\u0027 keeps the page empty. Embracing scribbles or strike-outs is one way to accept immutability, and when we get over the fascination we have with _starting over_, then we can _start into_ the work we want to create.",
